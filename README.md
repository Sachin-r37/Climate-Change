# Climate-Change
Environment Analysis of Earth using NDVI in R

Data is taken from "ftp://neoftp.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/rgb/MOD_NDVI_M/"

We segmentated the blocks based on fluctuations in the NDVI value over the time Period. Areas with high value of standard deviation indicates a large variance. We can see from the results that area near the North pole have seen a lot of impact due to climate change.
